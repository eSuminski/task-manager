This is a VS Code extension project. 
Please use the get_vscode_api with a query as input to fetch the latest VS Code API references as needed.
The project is a Task Manager extension that follows a kanban style layout with three columns: TODO, DOING, and DONE.
There is a TODO.md file that outlines project work
React is the preferred framework for the UI, and the extension uses a custom Webview panel to display the task manager interface
